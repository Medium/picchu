                              service to which the request/connection will be sent
                              after processing a routing rule. The destination.name
                              should unambiguously refer to a service in the service
                              registry. It can be a short name or a fully qualified
                              domain name from the service registry, a resolvable
                              DNS name, an IP address or a service name from the service
                              registry and a subset name. The order of inference is
                              as follows: \n 1. Service registry lookup. The entire
                              name is looked up in the service registry. If the lookup
                              succeeds, the search terminates. The requests will be
                              routed to any instance of the service in the mesh. When
                              the service name consists of a single word, the FQDN
                              will be constructed in a platform specific manner. For
                              example, in Kubernetes, the namespace associated with
                              the routing rule will be used to identify the service
                              as <servicename>.<rulenamespace>. However, if the service
                              name contains multiple words separated by a dot (e.g.,
                              reviews.prod), the name in its entirety would be looked
                              up in the service registry. \n 2. Runtime DNS lookup
                              by the proxy. If step 1 fails, and the name is not an
                              IP address, it will be considered as a DNS name that
                              is not in the service registry (e.g., wikipedia.org).
                              The sidecar/gateway will resolve the DNS and load balance
                              requests appropriately. See Envoy's strict_dns for details.

                                    The destination.name should unambiguously refer
                                    to a service in the service registry. It can be
                                    a short name or a fully qualified domain name
                                    from the service registry, a resolvable DNS name,
                                    an IP address or a service name from the service
                                    registry and a subset name. The order of inference
                                    is as follows: \n 1. Service registry lookup.
                                    The entire name is looked up in the service registry.
                                    If the lookup succeeds, the search terminates.
                                    The requests will be routed to any instance of
                                    the service in the mesh. When the service name
                                    consists of a single word, the FQDN will be constructed
                                    in a platform specific manner. For example, in
                                    Kubernetes, the namespace associated with the
                                    routing rule will be used to identify the service
                                    as <servicename>.<rulenamespace>. However, if
                                    the service name contains multiple words separated
                                    by a dot (e.g., reviews.prod), the name in its
                                    entirety would be looked up in the service registry.
                                    \n 2. Runtime DNS lookup by the proxy. If step
                                    1 fails, and the name is not an IP address, it
                                    will be considered as a DNS name that is not in
                                    the service registry (e.g., wikipedia.org). The
                                    sidecar/gateway will resolve the DNS and load
                                    balance requests appropriately. See Envoy's strict_dns
                                    for details. \n The following example routes all
                                    traffic by default to pods of the reviews service

                              from the connection pool. Defaults to 5. When the upstream
                              host is accessed over HTTP, a 5xx return code qualifies
                              as an error. When the upstream host is accessed over
                              an opaque TCP connection, connect timeouts and connection
                              error/failure events qualify as an error.
